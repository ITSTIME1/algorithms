# Introducation
Hello, anyone who interested algorithms
This repository is using "python language". so if you want to see python grammar or how to work array, brute force, dfs, bfs, greedy, necessary basic mathematices maybe that is will help you.

# What information do I have ?
Continuously I am learning python grammar and algorithms from "baekjoon" and "google" sometimes I couldn't solve any problem but I have remained my code.
maybe The code you see may not be efficient because I've been doing it since I was a beginner so compare your code and my code if you do it you will know what's wrong with me and what's wrong with you.

# How often do I upload ?
I'm not sure but continuously I will upload my code.
